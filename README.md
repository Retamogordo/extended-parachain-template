## Cumulus

This project was originally forked from the Substrate Parachain Template.

The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the
[Substrate Devhub Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/)
for each release of Polkadot. It is generated directly to the upstream
[Parachain Template in Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template)
at each release branch using the
[Substrate Template Generator](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-template-generator/).
